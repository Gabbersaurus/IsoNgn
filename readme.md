# IsoNgn
An HTML5 Canvas game engine with ES6 support.
Do not use the current version, some engine classes have to be moved to different folders and there is no documentation at the moment.
More info coming *soon&trade;*.

#License
The current version of this engine is released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/Gabbersaurus/IsoNgn/blob/master/LICENSE).
This means that it can be used commercially but if you'd like to donate to support my dream of VR development, server costs for potential coming online games or just to buy me a bowl of pasta you can message me on telegram @[dj_lsa](http://telegram.me/dj_lsa).
